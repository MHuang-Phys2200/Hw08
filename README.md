=========
Varying Velocity
---------------------
![alt tag](https://github.com/MHuang-Phys2200/Hw08/blob/master/glider1.png)

At low speeds the paper glider is not fast enough to fly for long, while at 
higher speeds it generates too much lift and makes a loop.
Varying Angle
---------------------

At high angles the paper glider makes a loop while at lower negative angles 
it accelerates and generates enough lift to gain altitude.
Varying Height
---------------------

With verying initial heights with all other initial variable constant the 
trajectory of the paper glider is the same.
